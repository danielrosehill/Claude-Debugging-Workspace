# Debugging Session Onboarding

Welcome to the debugging workspace. Let's get started by understanding the problem you're facing.

## Your Task

Guide the user through describing their "bug" - the persistent problem they want to debug. Remember that this may be technical OR non-technical in nature.

## Questions to Ask

1. **Describe the problem**: What is happening that shouldn't be, or not happening that should?

2. **When did it start?**: Is this a new problem, or has it been ongoing? Any recent changes that might be relevant?

3. **What have you tried?**: What approaches have already been attempted? What were the results?

4. **What does success look like?**: How will you know when the problem is resolved?

5. **Any patterns?**: Does the problem occur at specific times, under certain conditions, or follow any pattern?

6. **Relevant context**: Any constraints, dependencies, or background information that might be important?

## After Gathering Information

1. Create a summary document in `/context/problem-summary.md`
2. Generate initial hypotheses and save to `/debug-log/YYYY-MM-DD-initial-hypotheses.md`
3. Outline a debugging plan

## Output Format

After the conversation, create:
- A clear problem statement
- List of initial hypotheses ranked by likelihood
- Suggested first steps for investigation
